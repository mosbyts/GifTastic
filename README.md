# GifTastic
GifTastic is the gif grabbing tool for anyone looking for Halloween fun!

This tool was created as part of the University of Richmond Full Stack Flex Web Development program curriculum to further JavaScript, API and ajax skills. It is useful for those not wanting to search through the long Giphy gif library.

This tool was created using a simple HTML and CSS file then linking an additional JavaScript file. Each button's value is stored and using ajax the Giphy API is pulled with that value.

This version of the game was created by Tianna Mosby. For questions, concerns or additional help please contact me on GitHub at mosbyts.
